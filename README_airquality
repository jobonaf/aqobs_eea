**README - PM10 Air Quality Measurements around Brugnera, Italy**

**Dataset title:** PM10 concentration measurements from air quality monitoring stations around Brugnera, Italy
**Period covered:** 2013–2024
**File format:** Two CSV files with different temporal aggregations

---

### 1. Description

This dataset contains PM10 (Particulate Matter < 10 µm) concentration measurements from air quality monitoring stations located within a 100km bounding box centered on Brugnera, northeastern Italy. The data are extracted from the European Environment Agency (EEA) Air Quality e-Reporting system and include both hourly and daily aggregated measurements.

### 2. File structure

The dataset consists of two CSV files:

| File | Description | Temporal resolution |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| `PM10_aroundBrugnera_hourly_with_metadata.csv` | Hourly PM10 measurements | 1-hour intervals |
| `PM10_aroundBrugnera_daily_with_metadata.csv` | Daily PM10 measurements | 24-hour aggregates |

Both files share the following 22-column structure:

| Variable | Description | Unit / Format |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `Samplingpoint` | Full sampling point identifier | EEA format (e.g., `IT/SPO.IT1097A_5_BETA_2010-07-29_00:00:00`) |
| `Pollutant` | Pollutant code | 5 (PM10) |
| `Pollutant_Code` | Pollutant numerical code | 5 |
| `Pollutant_Name` | Pollutant description | "Particulate matter < 10 µm (aerosol)" |
| `Air Quality Station EoI Code` | Station identifier | EEA code (e.g., `IT1097A`) |
| `Air Quality Station Name` | Station name and location | Descriptive name |
| `Longitude` | Geographic longitude | Decimal degrees |
| `Latitude` | Geographic latitude | Decimal degrees |
| `Start` | Measurement period start | YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS |
| `End` | Measurement period end | YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS |
| `Value` | PM10 concentration value | µg/m³ |
| `Unit` | Measurement unit | `ug.m-3` |
| `Unit_Label` | Unit description | "Micrograms per cubic meter" |
| `Validity` | Data validity flag | 1 = valid |
| `Verification` | Verification status code | 1-3 |
| `Verification_Label` | Verification description | "Verified", "Not verified" |
| `DataCapture` | Data capture information | - |
| `AggType` | Aggregation type | `hour` or `day` |
| `ResultTime` | Result processing timestamp | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS |
| `Station_clean` | Simplified station ID | EEA code (e.g., `IT1097A`) |
| `SamplingPoint_clean` | Simplified sampling point ID | Base identifier |
| `Air Quality Network` | Monitoring network code | EEA network identifier |
| `Air Quality Station Area` | Station area classification | `urban`, `suburban`, `rural` |
